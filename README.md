# ankiweb

This fork packages the project as **anki-lan-web**: a small, mobile-first, Docker-deployed
personal Anki server. It pins the official Anki engine and matching browser assets, stores
the collection on a bind mount, and runs without a desktop environment or VNC container.
See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md), and the
[implementation specification](SPEC.md).

## Docker quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# replace change-me with a long password
./scripts/pilot.sh
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:18082>. The pilot binds to loopback by default, so it can run beside
an existing Anki installation without exposing a new LAN service. Run `./scripts/verify.sh`
to check health and collection integrity, and `./scripts/backup.sh` for a quiescent backup.
The runtime image is roughly 75 MB of filesystem data (about 312 MB in Docker's displayed
layer accounting), rather than a multi-gigabyte desktop container.

A **browser port of Anki desktop + AnkiConnect**, built on the official `anki` Python
package (pylib) + FastAPI. It serves Anki's real study UI in a browser and re-implements
the full AnkiConnect HTTP API — for a single user, on your own machine.

**It is a faithful translation, not a rewrite.** Where Anki ships a compiled frontend
(the SvelteKit pages for graphs / deck options / change-notetype / imports / image
occlusion, and the `reviewer.js` / `editor.js` bundles), ankiweb **reuses the vendored
build** and bridges it to the `anki` backend; the Qt-only dialogs (overview, custom study,
filtered-deck, export) are rebuilt as small server-rendered pages.

**Scope:** everything in the desktop study/edit/manage flow + the AnkiConnect API.
**Out of scope (by design):** sync (AnkiWeb) and add-ons/plugins.

## Screenshots

**Deck browser** — your full deck tree (including nested decks), counts, and the always-present
top toolbar. Anki's home screen, in a browser tab.

![Deck browser](docs/images/home.png)

**Studying** — the real Anki reviewer (`reviewer.js` + MathJax) drives the card; ankiweb adds a
card-action bar (mark · bury · suspend · set due · reset · delete · undo · flags) and keyboard
shortcuts.

![Reviewer](docs/images/reviewer.png)

**Browse & edit** — search, a deck/tag sidebar, the results table, and Anki's real `editor.js`
embedded live in the detail pane (with Fields… / Cards… / Preview).

![Browser](docs/images/browser.png)

**Reused, not rewritten** — where Anki ships a compiled SvelteKit page, ankiweb serves the
vendored build and wires it to the backend. Here's the full Deck Options screen, unchanged:

**Manage Note Types** — list / add / rename / delete note types, with links into the field and
card-template editors (one of the Tools-menu screens ankiweb rebuilds for the web):

## Requirements

- Python **3.12**
- `anki==26.9.3` (pinned — the vendored frontend must match this version; the exact upstream
  Anki/AnkiConnect commits this port was built against are recorded in [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md))
- Node.js (only to build the ~2 KB shell bundle)
- A conda env is recommended: installing `anki` pulls a newer `protobuf` that can clash
  with other global packages, so keep it isolated.

## Setup

```bash
conda create -n ankiweb python=3.12 -y
conda run -n ankiweb pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 1. Vendor Anki's compiled frontend (downloads the aqt 26.9.3 wheel, extracts
#    _aqt/data/web/ into ankiweb/web_assets/ — gitignored). Required.
conda run -n ankiweb python tools/fetch_web_assets.py

# 2. Build the shell bridge bundle (shell_src/bootstrap.ts -> ankiweb/shell/static/bootstrap.js)
npm install && npm run build

# 3. (optional) for the Playwright integration tests
conda run -n ankiweb python -m playwright install chromium
```

## Run

```bash
conda run -n ankiweb python -m ankiweb
```

This starts **two servers in one process**:

| Port | Serves | Default | Configure with |
|------|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Web UI + WebSocket** | the browser study/edit UI and the `/ws` bridge (WS shares this port) | `127.0.0.1:8000` | `ANKIWEB_HOST` / `ANKIWEB_PORT` |
| **AnkiConnect HTTP API** | `POST /` JSON API for AnkiConnect clients (+ Swagger docs at [`/docs`](#api-docs-swagger)) | `127.0.0.1:8765` | `ANKIWEB_AC_HOST` / `ANKIWEB_AC_PORT` (or `ankiconnect.json`) |

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000> in a browser. The AnkiConnect port defaults to **8765** on
purpose — existing AnkiConnect clients/scripts work unchanged.

## Configuration

All settings have safe localhost defaults; override via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ANKIWEB_COLLECTION` | `~/.local/share/ankiweb/collection.anki2` | Path to the `.anki2` collection. The parent directory is created automatically; a fresh collection is created if the file doesn't exist. |
| `ANKIWEB_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Web UI bind address (`0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces). |
| `ANKIWEB_PORT` | `8000` | Web UI port. |
| `ANKIWEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated extra `Host` header values accepted past the DNS-rebinding guard (see **LAN access**). `*` disables the check. |
| `ANKIWEB_AC_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | AnkiConnect bind address (overrides `ankiconnect.json`). |
| `ANKIWEB_AC_PORT` | `8765` | AnkiConnect port (overrides `ankiconnect.json`). |
| `ANKIWEB_AC_KEY` | *(none)* | AnkiConnect `apiKey` (overrides `ankiconnect.json`). |
| `ANKIWEB_IMPORT_TMP_DIR` | `<collection dir>/import-tmp` | Where uploaded import/image files are staged before the backend reads them. |
| `ANKIWEB_LANG` | *(empty → English)* | UI language, an Anki locale code (e.g. `zh-CN`, `ja`, `de`, `fr`). Chosen at startup — there is no in-app switcher; changing it means changing this var and restarting. See **Language** below. |
| `ANKIWEB_PASSWORD` | *(empty → no password)* | If set, the web UI requires this password (a `/login` page sets a session cookie). Empty = open, the default. The AnkiConnect API keeps its own `ANKIWEB_AC_KEY`. |
| `ANKIWEB_PASSWORD_HASH` | *(empty)* | Optional Argon2id password hash. When set, it takes precedence over `ANKIWEB_PASSWORD`, so the plaintext password does not need to be stored in the environment. |
| `ANKIWEB_SECURE_COOKIE` | `false` | Set to `true` when clients reach the service over HTTPS. Adds the browser's `Secure` flag to the session cookie. |
| `ANKIWEB_SOURCE_URL` | *(empty)* | AGPL §13 Corresponding-Source location for this deployment, shown on the `/about` page (only relevant if you run it as a public network service). |

**`ankiconnect.json`** (optional) lives next to the collection file and uses AnkiConnect's
own keys; environment variables override it:

```json
{ "webBindAddress": "127.0.0.1", "webBindPort": 8765, "apiKey": null,
  "webCorsOriginList": ["http://localhost"], "ignoreOriginList": [] }
```

### LAN access

To reach the UI from another device, bind to all interfaces **and** allow your host
(the Web UI has a DNS-rebinding guard that only permits localhost by default):

```bash
ANKIWEB_HOST=0.0.0.0 ANKIWEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS=192.168.1.50:8000 \
  conda run -n ankiweb python -m ankiweb
```

`ANKIWEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` accepts the value with or without a port (`192.168.1.50` matches
any port), multiple comma-separated hosts, or `*` to turn the check off (only on a trusted
network). It covers both HTTP and the WebSocket bridge.

### Language

Set `ANKIWEB_LANG` to any Anki locale code to run the whole UI in that language — both the
reused Anki frontend (graphs / deck options / reviewer / editor …) and ankiweb's own
hand-written screens (deck browser, browser, Add, Preferences, etc.):

```bash
ANKIWEB_LANG=zh-CN conda run -n ankiweb python -m ankiweb
```

The language is fixed at startup (it's applied before the collection is opened); there is
no in-app language switcher, so to change it you set `ANKIWEB_LANG` and restart. Empty or an
unknown code falls back to English. Accepts both `zh-CN` and `zh_CN` forms.

### Password

By default the web UI is open (no login) — it's a single-user, local-first app. To require a
password, set `ANKIWEB_PASSWORD`:

```bash
ANKIWEB_PASSWORD=mysecret conda run -n ankiweb python -m ankiweb
```

Visitors then get a `/login` page; the correct password sets a random, httponly, Strict
SameSite session cookie and unlocks the UI (and the `/ws` bridge). Sessions live server-side,
expire after 30 days, and are invalidated by a container restart. `/logout` revokes the
current session. Login attempts are rate-limited. This gates the **web app only**;
the AnkiConnect HTTP API (port 8765) is controlled separately by `ANKIWEB_AC_KEY`. It's a
serve over HTTPS and set `ANKIWEB_SECURE_COOKIE=true` outside a trusted LAN.

### API docs (Swagger)

The AnkiConnect server publishes interactive OpenAPI docs at
<http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs> (schema at `/openapi.json`). Every action has a standard
Pydantic request schema and a documented `POST /actions/<name>` route you can call straight
from the page ("Try it out"), e.g. `POST /actions/findCards` with body
`{"query": "deck:French is:due"}`.

These typed routes are an **additive convenience layer** — the canonical AnkiConnect contract
is unchanged: real clients still `POST /` with `{"action", "version", "params"}`, and the
`/actions/*` routes call the exact same dispatcher, so behavior never diverges. When
`ANKIWEB_AC_KEY` is set, send it as the `X-API-Key` header (use the **Authorize** button in
Swagger); the canonical `POST /` keeps reading the key from the request body as upstream does.

**Extra actions (ankiweb-original).** A few actions that are *not* part of AnkiConnect live
under a separate `/extra_actions/<name>` namespace — documented in `/docs` (tagged
`extra_actions`) and callable there, but deliberately **unknown to the canonical `POST /`**
dispatcher (so the root surface stays byte-identical to upstream). Currently:

- `POST /extra_actions/deleteModel` `{ "modelName": "MyType" }` (or `{ "modelId": 1234 }`) —
  delete an entire note type (the reverse of `createModel`). Returns `true`; **errors** if any
  note still uses it, if the type isn't found, or if it's the only remaining note type. The
  same `X-API-Key` gate applies.
- `POST /extra_actions/extendCardLimits` `{ "deck": "MyDeck", "new": 10, "review": -5 }` —
  temporarily add to (or subtract from) today's new/review card limits for a deck (the API form
  of Custom Study's "Increase today's … card limit"; negative reduces, deltas accumulate).
  Identify the deck by `deck` name or `deckId`. Returns the deck's resulting counts.
- `POST /extra_actions/getNotifyConfig` `{}` — read the [Deck push notifications](#deck-push-notifications-extras)
  config + live status.
- `POST /extra_actions/setNotifyConfig` `{ "enabled": true, "url": "https://…", "poll_sec": 30 }`
  — modify that config from outside (instead of the web form). Send only the fields you want to
  change (`enabled`/`url`/`token`/`poll_sec`/`retry_sec`/`scope`, plus optional `resync: true`);
  omitted fields keep their value. Takes effect live; returns the resulting config + status.

### Deck push notifications (Extras)

An **ankiweb-original** feature (not part of the Anki/AnkiConnect port): ankiweb can POST to an
endpoint of yours whenever a deck's study counts change — i.e. its `new_count`, `learn_count`,
or `review_count` moves (including bucket shifts that keep the total). Useful for a study
bot/agent that should react without polling.

Configure it live at **Extras ▾ → Push notifications** (`/notify`) — no env vars, no restart.
Settings persist to a `notify.json` sidecar next to the collection. Fields:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| Enabled | master on/off |
| POST URL | where to send notifications |
| Token | sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (omitted if empty) |
| Poll interval (sec) | how often the deck state is refreshed (one `deck_due_tree()` call — scales to thousands of decks) |
| Retry interval (sec) | how often a failed POST is resent |
| Scope | which decks to watch in a nested tree: **Leaf only** (default — last-level decks with no subdecks) or **All levels** (every deck; a parent's counts then include its subdecks) |

The notifier is active only when *enabled* and a URL and both intervals (> 0) are set. Decks are
identified by **full name** (`A::B::C`); counts are the same as `getDeckStats` (respect daily
limits). A deck notifies whenever its `(new_count, learn_count, review_count)` tuple changes —
any of the three, even if the total stays the same (the payload's `learnable` field is simply
`total > 0`, for convenience). With *All levels*, a parent's counts are the subdeck rollup;
*Leaf only* reports just the bottom-level decks. On start, on enable, on a URL/scope change, or
when you click *Save & re-push all*, every deck with nonzero counts (in scope) is pushed once so
your receiver syncs; always-empty decks stay silent.

**Request** ankiweb sends:

```
POST <url>
Authorization: Bearer <token>          # omitted when token is empty
Content-Type: application/json

{ "source": "ankiweb",
  "ts": 1780500000,                     # epoch seconds
  "changes": [
    { "deck": "英语词汇::单词", "deckId": 1780005159378, "learnable": true,
      "new_count": 12, "learn_count": 3, "review_count": 40 } ] }
```

**Success** = HTTP `200` **and** a JSON body with `ok` exactly `true`. Anything else (non-200,
missing/false `ok`, non-JSON, timeout, connection error) is treated as a failure and retried
every *retry interval* until it succeeds. While a notification is unacknowledged, further deck
changes are coalesced — the resend always carries the **latest** counts, and a deck that
reverts to its last acknowledged counts sends nothing. Deleted/renamed decks drop silently.

### Night mode

Toggle with the 🌙 button in the top toolbar (persisted in `localStorage`); it themes the
server-rendered pages and threads `#night` into links to the SvelteKit pages so those
render dark too.

### Navigation

Every server-rendered screen has an always-present top toolbar — **Decks · Add · Browse ·
Stats** (Anki's main-window toolbar, minus Sync) plus the night-mode toggle. The SvelteKit
pages (graphs, deck options, change-notetype, imports, image occlusion) are task pages
opened from there; use the browser's back button to return.

## Architecture

- **`anki` pylib** owns the collection, scheduler (v3), and the Rust backend (protobuf).
- **`ankiweb/collection_service.py`** — a single-worker, serialized wrapper around the one
  `Collection` (pylib objects aren't thread-safe). An auxiliary pool runs the thread-safe
  Rust calls that must be concurrent (FSRS compute/simulate + `latest_progress` polling) so
  deck-options shows live optimize progress.
- **`ankiweb/assets.py`** — serves the vendored Anki frontend (`/_anki/...`, `/_app/...`)
  and routes the reused SvelteKit SPA pages.
- **`ankiweb/anki_rpc/`** — `POST /_anki/{method}`: passthrough / custom / concurrent
  dispatch to `col._backend.<method>_raw` (protobuf in, protobuf out).
- **`ankiweb/bridge/`** — the WebSocket `/ws` `pycmd` bridge that the screens use to talk to
  the server (the desktop `pycmd`/`bridgeCommand` shim, in `shell_src/bootstrap.ts`).
- **`ankiweb/screens/`** — server-rendered pages (deck browser, overview, reviewer, browser,
  editor, add, custom study, filtered deck, export) that mount Anki's real `reviewer.js` /
  `editor.js` where applicable.
- **`ankiweb/ankiconnect/`** — the AnkiConnect HTTP API (≈120 actions, minus sync).
- **`ankiweb/__main__.py`** — runs the Web app and the AnkiConnect app as two uvicorn
  servers on a shared collection + bridge hub.

## Test

```bash
conda run -n ankiweb python -m pytest            # full suite (Playwright tests skip if chromium absent)
```

Integration tests use Playwright + real Chromium against a live uvicorn server; install the
browser once with `python -m playwright install chromium`.
