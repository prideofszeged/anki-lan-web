## Anki — `anki` pylib (linked at runtime) + vendored compiled frontend

- Upstream: <https://github.com/ankitects/anki> (version **26.9.3**; `aqt` 26.9.3)
- Copyright (C) Ankitects Pty Ltd and the Anki contributors (see upstream `CONTRIBUTORS`)
- License: **AGPL-3.0-or-later**, with some user contributions under **BSD-3-Clause**.

ankiweb `import`s the `anki` Python library (collection, scheduler, Rust backend) at
runtime, and vendors Anki's **compiled frontend** — extracted from the `aqt` 26.9.3 wheel
(`_aqt/data/web/`: the SvelteKit SPA, `reviewer.js`, `editor.js`, the congrats page, CSS) by
`tools/fetch_web_assets.py` into `ankiweb/web_assets/` — and serves those bundles unmodified
(`/_anki/...`, `/_app/...`). Those compiled bundles are Anki object code under
AGPL-3.0-or-later. The **Corresponding Source** for them is the Anki/aqt 26.9.3 source at the
upstream repository above.

Anki's logo is Copyright Alex Fraser, licensed under AGPL-3.0. (Upstream's limited
alternative logo license permits using the logo only to *refer to* Anki in external content;
it does not relax the AGPL when the logo is shipped inside this derived app.)

### Components vendored *inside* the Anki frontend (permissive, AGPL-compatible)

| Component | License |
|-----------|---------|
| MathJax | Apache-2.0 |
| jQuery, jQuery-UI | MIT |
| plot.js | MIT |

## AnkiConnect — re-implemented HTTP API (`ankiweb/ankiconnect/`)

- Upstream: <https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect>
- Copyright 2016–2021 Alex Yatskov (source headers); LICENSE file: 2016–2019 Alex Yatskov
- License: **GPL-3.0-or-later** (see [LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt](LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt))

ankiweb's `ankiconnect/` package re-implements ~120 AnkiConnect actions by closely following
the upstream source; it is a derivative work. GPLv3 §13 and AGPLv3 §13 grant the reciprocal
permission to combine GPL-3 and AGPL-3 code, so these portions are conveyed as part of the
AGPL-3.0-or-later combined work while remaining GPL-3.0-or-later in origin.

## Corresponding Source (AGPL §13)

Because ankiweb is a network service, every user interacting with it over a network is
entitled to the Corresponding Source of the running version. The app exposes a **Source**
link (top toolbar → `/about`); set `ANKIWEB_SOURCE_URL` to the location of your deployed
source. The pinned Anki/aqt 26.9.3 source is at <https://github.com/ankitects/anki> and the
AnkiConnect source at <https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect>.
